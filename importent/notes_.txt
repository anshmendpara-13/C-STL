-   Maximum size of the array: We must be knowing that the maximum size of the array declared inside the main function is of the order of 10^6 
but if you declare the array globally then you can declare its size up to 10^7. 
-   vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their  storage
being handled automatically by the container.
