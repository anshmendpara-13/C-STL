The NaN values are used to identify undefined or non-representable values for floating-point elements, such as the square root of negative numbers or the result of 0/0.

The next representable value after x in the direction of y.
If x is the largest finite value representable in the type, and the result is infinite or not representable, an overflow range error occurs.
