construct vector
-   empty container construct
construct an empty.   
container with no elements
-   fill construct
constructs a container with n elements.
each elements is a copy of val.
-   range
[first, last)
emplace-constructed from its corresponding element in the range, in the same order
-   copy constructor
constructs a container with a copy of each of the elements in x, in the same order

vector in STL
-   vector are the same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted
,with their storage being handled automatically by the container. vector elements are placed in continuous storage so that they
can be accessed and traversed using iterators.
-   in vector, data is inserted at the end.
-   inserting at the end takes differential time, as sometimes the array may need to be extended.
-   removing the last element takes only constant time because no resizing happens.
-   inserting and erasing at the beginning or in the middle is linear in time.
