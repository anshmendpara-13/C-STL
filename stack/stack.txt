constructs a stack container adaptor object
a stack of the same type (i.e, with the same template arguement, T and container)

stack in STL
stack are a type of container adaptors with lifo (last in first out) type of working,
where a new element is added at one end(top) and an element is removed from that end only.
stack uses an encapsulated object of either vector or deque (by default) or list (sequential coantainer)
as its underlying container, providing a specific of member functions to access its element

for creating a stack, we must include the <stack> header file in our code.
we then use this syntax to define the :- stack

->  template<class type,class container = deque<type> class stack;

type - is the type of element container in the stack.
it can be any valid c++ type or even a user-defined type.

coantainer - is the type of underlying container object.

member type :-
value_type - the first template parameter, T. it denotes the element type.
container_type - the second template parameter, container. it denotes the underlying container type.
size_type - usigned intergral type.
